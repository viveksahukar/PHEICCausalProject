# PHEICCausalProject
This is a repository on the causal analysis of the impact PHEIC having on China's economic outlook


# Project Description
According to Wikipedia, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is a formal declaration by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) of "an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health 
risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international 
response".

Recently, WHO just issued its 6th PHEIC in history to Chinaâ€™s recent outbreak of novel coronavirus. While some argue 
that PHEIC could help curb the epidemic situation as countries become more alarmed of the situation and thus take 
necessary steps to prevent it from spreading further, others argue that it could cause the economic outlook of infected 
countries to deteriorate further.

Thus our project aims to discover whether there is any causality between PHEIC and the economic outlook of infected 
countries and regions.
